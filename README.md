### Announcements  

## March 2022
New standard practice.  Always use logic controllgers such as ```.andifQ() .andQ() .orifQ() .orQ()``` when more than one condition is utilized in a block of script.

Created a [RuleZ Wiki](https://github.com/gfcrbg/RuleZ/wiki).


## August 2020

For numerical input, ```.clearAnswer``` will set the value to '0'.  
This doesn't fully clear the answer, as '0' is still considered a value.  The user must manually delete the '0' for the QID to be considered clear.  
Basically, do not use ```.clearAnswer``` for numerical input.


## October 2019

Benfits of transferring to this platform:

- Better navigation
- Better file managment
- Search
- Version control
- Collaboration
- Export repositories
